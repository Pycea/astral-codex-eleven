Before packaging the extension:

  - smoke test on Chrome & Firefox
  - ensure the version number in manifest.json has been bumped!

To package, run ./build.sh (or equivalently, `make dist`).

To publish a new addon, Firefox requires adding the following snippet to be
added to extension/manifest.json:

  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "astral-codex-eleven@verver.ch"
    }
  }

It shouldn't be necessary to include this in subsequent updates. More info:
