To release a new version:

 1. Summarize the changes in CHANGELOG.txt

 2. Bump the version in manifest.json

 3. Run tests with `make test` (limited coverage)

 4. Create a .zip file with ./build.sh (or equivalently, `make dist`).

 5. Smoke test on Chrome and Firefox (see below for details)

    To load for testing/development:

      - Chrome: chrome://extensions/ (Load Unpacked)
      - Firefox: about:debugging (Load Temporary Add-On)

    Make sure only ONE version of the extension is installed!

 6. Upload new version.

      - Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/
      - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons

 7. Commit the changes to CHANGELOG.txt and manifest.json

 8. Create a git tag (make sure manifest.json )

    % git tag v0.1     # replace v0.1 with the current version
    % git push --all


Things to test before release:

  - Navigation:

      - Click a post link from the home page (e.g. one of the top posts);
        the comments on the post page should load in the extension widget.

      - Click the home page link from the post page.

  - Comment ordering: verify switching between "Chronological" and "New First"
    works as expected.

  - Keyboard navigation:

    - Verify all keys work, in both "Chronological" and "New First" ordering.
    - Verify tab navigation works (all interactive fields are reachable,
      dates expand when you focus on them, all elements have visible focus).

  - Mouse support:

    - Dates expand when hovering over them.
    - Links have underlines when hovering over them.
    - Clicking on the left border line of a comment collapses/expands it.
    - Comment author links to Substack user profile page.
    - Comment date links to comment permalink.

  - Comment API (warning, this makes publicly-visible changes!):

    - Create a top-level comment.
    - Add a reply.
    - Edit the reply.
    - Refresh the page and verify the comments look as expected.
    - Delete the reply.
    - Delete the top-level comment.
