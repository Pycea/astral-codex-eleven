Description of the filter rules defined in filter-rules.json:

1. redirect *://www.astralcodexten.com/api/v1/post/*/comments?*

This redirects the regular script that fetches comments to an empty JSON
file, which prevents it from populating the comment section (which is too slow).
It's a redirect because blocking the request would cause the page to retry
indefinitely!


2. allow *://www.astralcodexten.com/api/v1/post/*/comments?*&comment_id=*

This allows comment deeplinks to work as normally. The idea is that you should
be able to use these to reply to threads, which the extension currently doesn't
support on the main post page.


3. allow *://www.astralcodexten.com/api/v1/post/*/comments?no-filter&*

The no-filter query component is used by the extension to fetch comments while
bypassing the redirect; without this, the extension wouldn't be able to fetch
comments either!
